3:00-3:10
	Starting up class
3:11-3:16
	Were starting pointers and malloc today
	she's explaining why she's done what she's done so far
		she's heard rumors, ect. about how, idk im very 
		confused what she's trying to do
	She seems to be leading up to teaching us C again... five weeks in...
3:16-3:30
	Intro to pointers & Malloc
	Im going through her code
	she spend a minute derailing us by bringing up an old encoder (EBCIiC)
3:30-3:40
	Discussing HAL - hardware abstraction layer
	She focuses alot on how everything is abstracted these days
	Discussing how the microprocessor is also abstracted
	Oh and Assembly is fake too (on intel - modern pcs)
3:40-4:32
	Going back to the code

	Q: Do i need a char pointer to point to a char?
		ie:
			char thing = 'a';
			int *ptr = &thing

4:32-
	Shes on program 11 from her word doc

	Q: What does the * do?
		ie:
			struct node *link = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));

			whats the difference between *link and node*?
	
	Shes on program 12
	
	LOOK UP pointer arithmetics
